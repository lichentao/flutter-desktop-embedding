# flutter_visual_builder

The widgets which the source gets transformed to.

## Usage in the IDE

The IDE is build as a collection of microservices. This makes for great
extensibillity especially, it allows to integrate different services in other
IDEs using plugins.

These are the components:

- The IDE itself is written in Flutter and hosts the editor and general IDE
features.

- The Dart-Analysis Server

- The Observatory

- The standalone running application. This is inside a new process, meaning there
is no runtime access to it. 
It can be started in a different window, on a phone or even embedded into the
IDE using the same technique as the WebView and Maps plugin.

- The App-Link is the bridge between the running app and the IDE. It is a server
which runs on the local machine. It has following tasks:

    - Convert the original source code into the modified source code which
    is used by the Visual-Builder (always have it as a copy so nothing can be lost)
    
    - Convert the modified source code back to the original
    
    - Handle live updates. If something is changed in the visual editor, it should
    be reflect in the code at the same time. This is also true if the code is changed
    the app should reflect those changes.



# New Discovery

The widget inspector does something very similar. 
Using a Dart Kernel Transformer you can hook yourself into the compilation and change source code.
/// [Dart Kernel Transformer](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/wiki/Kernel-Documentation).

The widget inspector does this for example when adding the file path and line number to widgets.

Here is the actual transformer code:

# Server (copied form old server project)

## Usage

**Using the managed version:**

Start up the server:
 
```
dart <path_to_this_project>\bin\managed_server.dart --deviceId = "Desktop"
```

Arguments:

- deviceId
- width
- height

this will launch the a new layout builder on the selected device. 

Using the client:

Add this project to your dependencies:
```
visual_client: any
```



## Structure

The client contains all the code needed to interact with the running instance.

Managed_instance only exposes methods to read and set values of widgets, whereby 
raw_widget also returns a widget which can be included in an app.


## Client

The client supports two different use cases. It can either return a 
fully connected and set up widget which can be directly used.

Or it can start up and manage a separate Flutter instance. In this cause
is is possible to choose the medium it should run Flutter on (Desktop or
any mobile phone).

## Generating grpc code

Run the following command in the project root

```
 protoc -I protos/ protos/server.proto --dart_out=grpc:lib/generated --plugin=protoc-gen-dart=c:\Users\[youruser]\AppData\Roaming\Pub\Cache\bin\protoc-gen-dart.bat
```

in my case:
```
 protoc -I protos/ protos/server.proto --dart_out=grpc:lib/generated --plugin=protoc-gen-dart=c:\Users\Norbert\AppData\Roaming\Pub\Cache\bin\protoc-gen-dart.bat
```
